</div>

## Getting Started
Make sure you have `node` and all the dependencies installed.

Simply run the command
```shell
npm start
```
in the root directory of the project and navigate to the url in any modern browser.

## Installation
First, clone the repository with the command,
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vnnm404/Cherry.git
```

then install `node` for whichever platform you are on, then install the following dependencies,
`express`, `socket.io`, `ejs`, `http`, `assert` and  `path`. This can be done with the comand,
```shell
npm install express ejs http assert path socket.io
```

`cd` into the repo then run the app with the command,
```shell
npm start
```
to start the app, its locally hosted by default on `PORT` 5500. This can be configured in `./src/index.js` or by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Usage
First start the app, then nagivate to the hosted url in modern browser, and wait to find a match or generate a link and play with a friend! This is demonstrated in the followings gifs.

To simply play with another user, both users can simply play as guest and their matches aren't saved on the server.

To play with a friend we can generate a link, this link is shared with your friend and this sets up a match between you both instead of matchmaking with random people.

To login, visit the root `/` page or the `/index` page and either sign up or sign in. No restrictions are imposed other than the password must be non empty and the username can't already exist when signing up. A login produces a session for authentication which expires in a day.
